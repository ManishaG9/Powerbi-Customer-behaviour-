Insights:
West Region Dominates in Purchases and Loyalty:

Users from the West region show the highest purchase frequency and loyalty scores, indicating a strong customer base and brand loyalty. This could be due to better services, product availability, or higher disposable income in this region.
East Region Underperforming:

The East region has the lowest purchase frequency, loyalty score, and income. Efforts should be made to understand the reasons behind this, such as potential barriers to product adoption, lack of awareness, or affordability issues.
Income Growth Correlates with Age:

There is a steady increase in average income as customers age, with a significant peak at around 60 years old. Targeting older age groups with premium products could yield higher returns.
Purchase Frequency Decline Across Regions:

There is a noticeable drop in purchase frequency from the West to the East region. This may suggest regional disparities in access or interest in the product, and marketing efforts should focus on increasing engagement in underperforming regions.
Income vs. Purchases:

While the West and South regions have higher incomes, this correlates with higher purchase amounts. The North and East regions, with lower incomes, show reduced purchase activity. Tailoring pricing or offering targeted discounts in lower-income regions could improve purchase rates.
Loyalty Disparity:

The significant difference in loyalty scores between regions highlights that certain areas (West and South) are more engaged and loyal, while the East requires attention. Implementing loyalty programs in the East could help increase repeat purchases.
By focusing on these KPIs and insights, the company can target marketing strategies, adjust product offerings, and engage customers in underperforming regions to maximize overall growth.
